## Education			        		
- B.A., Computer Science and Statistics | Harvard University (_May 2017_)

## Work Experience
**Data Science Manager @ Fivestars by SumUp (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses

**Data Scientist @ Amazon (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Regional Forecasting Model: Created a time series model which decomposes order units and sales of the US county-level forecast into MSA (a group of counties) level with an error rate of +-3%. Chose the best model with backtesting and optimized hyper-parameters with HyperOpt. The result is published on Tableau every morning, which allows the risk team and fulfillment center to identify anomalies or forecast misses by comparing the forecast data to actual data.
- Anomaly Detection Model: Created an anomaly detection model with STL by taking trends, weekly seasonality, and special events (Prime Day) into account. The model successfully identifies the anomaly data points, which were flagged manually at weekly callouts. It made weekly callouts more scalable at more granularities and way less time-consuming.

**Data Scientist @ TripAdvisor (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Short-term user value model: Owned User Value Model, which calculates the value of each user action on the TripAdvisor website and is crucial to the entire Search Engine Marketing Team (especially bidding). Replaced old multiple linear regression model with XGBoost model on Kubernetes and MLflow platforms. Intuitively explained the XGBoost model to stakeholders by visualizing feature importance with SHAP values and the expected impact of the new model on error reductions and revenue increase.
- Marketing Attribution Model: Developed new offline models to predict revenue incurred by each hotel booking and to predict hotel booking conversion rate of each click. Collaborated with an engineer to productionize codes and successfully pushed to the live site. Used elastic net regression and cross-validation to select useful features and reduced RMSE of hotel booking revenue prediction by 50%. This model was used across different teams at TripAdvisor. For example, Hotel Sorting Team had an 8% booking revenue increase by using this new model prediction as one of the features. Moreover, this model has been widely used at TripAdvisor to allocate revenue from providers that do not share revenue data with TripAdvisor.
**Data Scientist Intern @ Facebook (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- AB Test: Detected anomaly drop-off points and unnatural flow of users on Facebook Platform and drove a team of about 20 engineers
to conduct A/B tests by changing the description of stages where users tend to drop off. Predicted user completion rate with logistic regression based on variables such as user experience, past revenue, and country

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
